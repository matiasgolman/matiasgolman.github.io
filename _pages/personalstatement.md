I appreciate your interest in my work trajectory. 

While a CV and a list of publications effectively capture standardised productivity and work experience, I believe they tell only part of the story when it comes to understanding a person's trajectory and potential.

If I were on the hiring side of the equation, I would be interested in having on my team someone who is not only productive, original, passionate, and committed to their tasks, but also whom I could share values, interesting debates, and who is eager about learning and growing together. The upcoming paragraphs aim to be an informal but more comprehensive introduction of myself and my values.

I was born in Bariloche, in the Argentine Patagonia. That, alone, explains a substantial part of who I am and what motivates me. Let me explain.

Since I was very young, I developed a strong attachment to nature. I love hiking, camping and pretty much any activity that involves being in contact with fresh air. I refill my energy and spirit when in nature. I value the amazement of the discovery process and the thrill of dealing with the unexpected rather than the certainty of a travel book with perfect instructions on where to go. I don't follow blogs' recommendations on *the most scenic view*. I like the learning of exploring. I take risks. I am objective-oriented, but enjoy the path.

My passion for economics and development started in my early teenage years. To visit my grandparents, I used to take a 21h bus (1600km) to Buenos Aires, crossing a variety of landscapes and social realities. My mind would just get lost for hours (and still does) into thinking about how to improve prosperity in such diverse settings, and how to create jobs that allow people to have a decent life. Basically, trying to understand the reasons behind the underdevelopment.

Argentina, like any Latin American country, is highly unequal. Its dualities go from Nobel Prize winners to half of the children living in poverty. Economics discussions --- mostly inflation --- are part of everyday talks. Socratic exchanges are held in any grocery shop, in every taxi ride, in any meeting with friends. I really enjoy listening to other's perspectives, and feel very comfortable expressing my thoughts and having a thorough debate of ideas. 

I have always been very receptive to the region's disparities, and since a very early age, I wanted to understand its roots better and contribute to reducing them somehow. By specialising in labour economics, I gained thorough knowledge on informality, unemployment, wage gaps, and skill mismatches. I have a problem-solving approach: I am not satisfied just recognising an inefficiency or injustice, but I immediately try to think of solutions to it. I have an active and cooperative way of behaving. 

I have an empirical approach towards research and science: my interests are triggered by an initial spark, conversation and learning from what is happening in the real world. I value abstract theory, but my inner curiosity is driven by reality. While I believe that the major changes happen at the macro level, with transformative policies, I think these should be inspired by micro-level experiences. In other words, I believe that research and policy greatly benefits when we complement rigorous analysis with direct engagement with the community. Both for ideas generation and dissemination. Following Simone Weil's example of combining intellectual work with direct experience, I believe understanding and fighting poverty requires more than reading and writing about it - it requires genuine involvement in activities that seek to reduce it. I actively participate in volunteering roles that expose me to the reality of what I am trying to understand, or participate in community activities that entail interactions with more than highly educated academics, who actually experience these problems firsthand. I think of research not as a means to advance professionally, but as a means of scientific support to change.

Having studied at the University of Buenos Aires involves many things. There were many learnings besides the purely academic (which were fantastic). One of the most important realisations is that, since the University is *free*, students don't end up with private debts. Of course, *free* means it is sustained with general taxes. So, rather than a private debt, every graduate finishes with a social debt. Any personal success is never just an individual success, as it already entails a social investment. In a country with extended poverty and inequality, financing quality higher education carries an extra load for the opportunity costs of other poverty-alleviating public investments. Any form of success I can achieve, I am aware, carries that responsibility. I want to contribute to a word that reduces the access gaps to opportunities like the one I was privileged to have.

During my career, I have gained thorough econometrics and programming skills. I am self-sufficient in processing large quantities of data, from diverse sources, with different softwares, and develop empirically relevant and methodologically thorough research questions. Certainly, I believe in data-driven policy decisions, and I aim to identify heterogeneous effects within population groups, specially focusing on vulnerable populations.

I think one of my core skills is that I love learning new things. I am curious and open-minded about both work-related abilities and general knowledge, be it different languages, hobbies, and basically different ways of doing things. I believe the same problem can have multiple solutions, and there is always a different perspective to understand and solve them. I have a strong capacity to adapt and I  work well in multi-cultural environments. I am passionate when teaching, whether in economics at university level, mathematics at high school level or languages in refugee-oriented NGOs.

When looking at my CV and my publications, you will likely get a good impression of my research interest and my technical skills. What these cannot show by construction, and I hope it is clearer after reading this attempt of personal review, is the passion and commitment I will provide. 

Thanks for reading!
