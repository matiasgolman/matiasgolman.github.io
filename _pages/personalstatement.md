I appreciate your interest in my work trajectory. 

While a CV or list of publications effectively captures standardized productivity and work experience, I believe they tell only part of the story when it comes to understanding a person's comprehensive trajectory and potential.

If I were on the hiring side of the equation, I would be interested in having on my team someone who is not only productive, original, passionate, and committed to their tasks, but also whom I could share values, interesting debates, and who is eager about learning and growing together. The upcoming paragraphs are an informal introduction of myself and my values, aiming to reduce the information gap from the CV.

I was born in Bariloche, in the Argentine Patagonia. That, alone, explains a substantial part of who I am and what motivates me. Let me explain.

Since I was very young, I developed a strong attachment to nature. I love hiking, camping and pretty much any activity that involves being in contact with fresh air. I refill my energy and spirit when in nature. I value the amazement of the discovery process and the thrill of dealing with the unexpected rather than the certainty of a travel book with perfect instructions on where to go. I don't follow blogs' recommendations on "the most scenic view". I like the learning of exploring, I take risks, I am objective-oriented, but learned to enjoy the path.

My passion for economics and development started in my early teenage years. To visit my grandparents, I used to take a 21h bus (1600km) to Buenos Aires, crossing a variety of landscapes and social realities. My mind would just get lost for hours (and still does) into thinking about how to improve prosperity in such diverse settings, and how to create jobs that allow people to have a decent life. Basically, trying to understand the reasons behind the underdevelopment.

Argentina, like any Latin American country, is highly unequal. Its dualities go from Nobel Prize winners to half of the compatriots living in extreme poverty. Economics discussions -- mostly inflation -- are part of everyday talks. Socratic exchanges are achieved in any grocery shop, in every taxi ride. I feel very comfortable listening, expressing my thoughts,  and having a thorough debate of ideas. 

I have always been very receptive to the region's disparities, and since a very early age, I wanted to understand its roots better and contribute to reducing them somehow. By specialising in labour economics, I gained thorough knowledge on informality, unemployment, wage gaps, and skill mismatches. I believe I have a problem-solving mindset: I am not satisfied just recognising an inefficiency or injustice, but I immediately try to think of solutions to it. I have an active, policy-oriented way of thinking and behaving. 

I have an empirical approach towards research: my interests are triggered by an initial spark, conversation and learning from what is happening in the real world. I value abstract theory, but my inner curiosity is driven by reality. While I believe that the major changes happen at the macro level, with transformative policies, I think these should be inspired by micro-level experiences. That said, I believe that research and policy benefits when we complement rigorous analysis with direct engagement with the community. Following Simone Weil's example of combining intellectual work with direct experience, I believe understanding poverty requires more than reading about it - it requires genuine involvement in activities that seek to reduce it. I actively participate in volunteering roles that expose me to the reality of what I am trying to understand, or participate in community activities that entail interactions with more than highly educated academics, who actually experience these problems firsthand. I think of research not as a means to advance professionally, but as a real means of scientific support to change.

Having studied at the University of Buenos Aires involves many things. There are many learnings besides the purely academic (which are fantastic). One of the most important realisations is that, since the University is free, students don't end up with private debts. Of course, free means it is paid with general taxes. So, rather than a private debt, any graduate finishes with a social debt. I understand very clearly that any personal success is never an individual success, and it entails a social investment. In a country with extended poverty, financing high-quality education to a few has an extra load of the opportunity cost of other poverty-alleviating investments. Any form of success I can achieve, I know, carries that responsibility, and I want contribute to science and policies that help reduce those systematic access gaps to opportunities.

During my career, I have gained thorough econometrics and programming skills. I am self-sufficient in processing large quantities of data, from diverse sources, and develop empirically relevant research questions. Certainly, I believe in data-driven decisions, but I am also aware of data limitations, and I always aim to understand heterogeneities within population groups. 

I think one of my core skills is that I love learning new things. I am curious and open-minded about both work-related abilities and general knowledge, be it different languages, hobbies, and basically different ways of doing things. I believe that leads to having a strong capacity to adapt and work well in multi-cultural environments. I enjoy teaching, whether in economics at university level, mathematics at high school level or languages in refugee-focused NGOs. I consider these experiences as part of both my growing path as well as part of the social repayment for the opportunities I had.

When looking at my CV or the publications available on this personal website, you will likely get a good impression of my research interests. What the list cannot show, and I hope the reader has a stronger idea after reading this attempt at personal description, is the passion and commitment I will provide. 

Thanks for reading!
