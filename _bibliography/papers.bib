  title={The effect of AI adoption on Personality Traits demand: evidence from Online Job Vacancies},
  year = {2025},
  abstract={This study examines the demand for Big Five personality traits in the UK labour market and their interaction with artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. Using text retrieval methods on 11.7 million online job vacancies (2017-2022), I find that 72 per cent of vacancies require at least one personality trait. Extraversion is most common (44 per cent), followed by Conscientiousness (34 per cent) and Openness (30 per cent). After accounting for occupational changes, personality demands remain mostly stable over time, with only Conscientiousness showing a decline (-2.1 percentage points) and Extraversion a modest increase (1.7 percentage points) by 2022. I use two approaches to study how AI affects personality demands. At the vacancy level, jobs requiring AI skills are more likely to demand Openness (7.2 percentage points) and less likely to demand other traits, even within the same firm and occupation. At the firm level, after companies adopt AI for the first time, they increase their demand for Openness (2.4 percentage points) across all subsequent hiring. These findings suggest that as firms adopt AI technologies, they increasingly value workers with traits associated with creativity and adaptability, both for AI-demanding positions and across their broader workforce.},

  title = {The Value of Personality: Exploring the Wage Penalty Paradox in the UK},
  year = {2025},
  abstract = {This study investigates the demand for the Big Five personality traits and their impact on employers' wage offers. Using text retrieval methods applied to 11.7 million online vacancies posted between 2017 and 2022, I construct dictionaries tailored to the Big Five to identify personality traits within UK job advertisements. I find that jobs mentioning personality traits offer 4.6 per cent lower wages on average, creating a paradox: why do employers use personality-related language if these traits are penalised? I test four potential explanations: correlation with other low-pay characteristics, compensating differentials through amenity provision, linguistic intensity effects, and demographic targeting strategies. Results show that occupation fixed effects produce the largest reduction in trait penalties, yet significant penalties persist. Penalties are larger in high-skill contexts but smaller in female-dominated occupations. Compensating differentials receive context-dependent support: trait penalties are substantially reduced when combined with traditional benefits and workplace culture signals, but amplified with remote work arrangements. Linguistic intensity analysis reveals strong non-linearities: low-intensity mentions often carry no penalty, whilst high-intensity mentions show substantial penalties. Machine learning analysis of implicit gender targeting contradicts demographic targeting predictions. These findings suggest that employers strategically use personality-trait language for multiple overlapping purposes—signalling genuine requirements at low intensity, facilitating compensating differentials with appropriate amenity bundles, and serving organizational signalling functions at high intensity—rather than reflecting a single mechanism.},

  abstract = {he primary goal of this research is to systematically analyze the effectiveness of formalization policies in Latin America and the Caribbean by conducting a meta-analysis of existing impact evaluations. Specifically, the objectives are: 1- To assess the effectiveness of various formalization policies, taking into account factors such as policy design, target population, country characteristics, and policy implementation context. 2- To provide evidence-based recommendations for future formalization policy designs that could be implemented across the region.},
